# Kafka-examples-in-Python
Before executing the code, we should know there are three main libraries in Python for interacting with Kafka. They are PyKafka, Kafka-python and Confluent Kafka Libraries.
first of all, we need to install the Kafak on the system. You can use the folliwng link to download a version of Kafka which is compatible with your system (in my case, I downloaded kafka-2.7.2-src.tgz):
https://kafka.apache.org/downloads

Verify that you have Java 8 or a later version installed by the following command in terminal:

'java -verson'
